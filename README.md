# AI_Email_Classifier  
An AI Email Classifier is a machine learning-based system designed to automatically categorize and prioritize incoming emails based on their content. By analyzing the text, subject, sender, and other metadata, the classifier can determine the relevance, urgency, or topic of each email. This allows for the automation of tasks such as spam filtering, sorting emails into folders (e.g., work, personal, promotions), and highlighting important messages that require immediate attention. The classifier can be trained using labeled datasets to improve accuracy over time, adapting to the specific needs of the user or organization.
